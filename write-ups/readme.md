# 🧠 TryHackMe Progress Tracker

Welcome to my **TryHackMe progress repo**, where I *actually* document what I’ve learned instead of trusting my goldfish-tier memory. This is part notebook, part therapy, part digital trophy case. 🏆

## 📌 Why This Exists

Let's be honest:

- I’ve typed `nmap -sC -sV -oN scan.txt` 400 times and still forget the flags.  
- My notes used to be on sticky notes, screenshots, and random Discord DMs to myself.  
- I need *somewhere* to pretend I’m organized when I’m crying over a privilege escalation rabbit hole.

So here we are. A GitHub repo to log my journey from “Wait, what’s a reverse shell?” to “I pwned this box in 12 minutes and only panicked twice.”

## 🗂️ What's Inside

Here’s how I’m pretending to stay organized:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `nmap-notes.md` | Port scans and why I always forget `-p-` |
| `enum-guide.md` | Because enumeration is 90% of hacking and 100% of my mental breakdown |
| `priv-esc.md` | My ongoing battle with `linpeas.sh` |
| `reverse-shells.md` | Copy-pasta collection of listener magic |
| `tears-and-victories.md` | Emotional logbook of rooms I’ve finished or been destroyed by |
| `rooms/` | Per-room notes, loot, and occasional memes |

## 🤖 How I Use This

1. I do a TryHackMe room.  
2. I cry.  
3. I Google furiously.  
4. I take messy notes.  
5. I come here and turn chaos into markdown.  
6. Future me thanks past me. (Sometimes.)
